    <h2>Some History:</h2>
    <p>The Maggi brand originates from Switzerland where in 1886 Julius Maggi created a recipe of flavours to bring added taste to meals. This marked the beginning of the Maggi brand and its convenient products. Known for his nutrition-oriented approach, the Swiss Government asked Julius Maggi to create a product that would be quick to prepare yet nutritious as more and more women were working outside the home. The results were a success — two instant pea soups and an instant bean soup.</p><br>
    <h2>Did you know?</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Every second, 4,600 food portions are prepared with Maggi across the world</li>
            <li>Every minute, consumers add 100 tonnes of fresh ingredients (meat, vegetables, rice and so on) to their Maggi meals</li>
            <li>Every hour, Maggi delivers 900,000 portions of vegetables to consumers through its products</li>
            <li>Compared to 2005, a year’s production of Maggi products already contains more than 12,000 tonnes less salt - the equivalent of the Eiffel tower in weight</li>
        </ul>
